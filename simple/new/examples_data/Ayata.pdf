## 1.1 

Ayata Incorporation was established in Nepal with the  mission to “reimagine digital information and technology usage” by  leveraging core strengths in information and communication technology  (ICT)[1](https://ayata.com.np/about.php). Co-founded by Ronesh Shrestha and led by CEO Abhisek Mahat, CTO Adarsh  Bajagain, and COO Amresh Subedi, the company prioritizes solving  real-world problems through scalable digital solutions[1](https://ayata.com.np/about.php)[3](https://np.linkedin.com/company/ayata-inc). Its founding philosophy centers on democratizing access to technology,  particularly for Nepal’s rural majority, where over 80% of the  population resides outside urban centers[2](https://ayata.com.np). By aligning with global trends in mobile penetration (exceeding 100%)  and internet adoption (63%), Ayata positions itself as a catalyst for  Nepal’s transition into a digitally empowered society[2](https://ayata.com.np).

Ayata’s healthcare innovations aim to digitize Nepal’s  fragmented medical infrastructure. Medicord, a blockchain-secured health records platform, replaces physical documents with interoperable  digital profiles, enabling seamless data sharing among hospitals like  Dhulikhel Hospital and Kathmandu Medical College[2](https://ayata.com.np)[10](https://ayata.com.np/services.php). Currently in development, Medicord emphasizes patient privacy and data  security, addressing Nepal’s lack of centralized health databases[3](https://np.linkedin.com/company/ayata-inc). Complementing this, Aura—a mobile application—tracks menstrual cycles,  pregnancy milestones, and maternal health indicators, providing  personalized insights to women in remote areas[3](https://np.linkedin.com/company/ayata-inc). These tools align with WHO’s digital health guidelines and have  garnered partnerships with ASHA Japan and Rutgers University for field  testing[1](https://ayata.com.np/about.php)[2](https://ayata.com.np).

## 2.2 

Avyaas represents Ayata’s flagship educational  initiative, designed to enhance digital literacy through interactive  learning modules. The platform offers 3D visualizations of complex  concepts, practice exams, and peer-to-peer knowledge sharing, targeting  Nepal’s student population[2](https://ayata.com.np)[6](https://ayata.com.np/works.php). By collaborating with institutions like Kyorin University and the  University of Tokyo, Avyaas integrates globally recognized pedagogical  methods into localized content, bridging gaps in STEM education  accessibility[2](https://ayata.com.np)[10](https://ayata.com.np/services.php). User reviews highlight a 5.0★ satisfaction rating, attributed to its  intuitive UI/UX and offline functionality for low-connectivity regions[10](https://ayata.com.np/services.php).

## 2.3 

In partnership with Siddhartha Bank, Nepal Investment  Bank, and Global IME Bank, Ayata develops customized banking software to streamline operations and enhance customer engagement[1](https://ayata.com.np/about.php)[2](https://ayata.com.np). Their solutions include mobile banking apps with vernacular language  support and fraud detection algorithms tailored to Nepal’s regulatory  environment. Additionally, Ayata promotes financial inclusion via agent  banking platforms that enable rural residents to perform transactions  without physical bank branches[2](https://ayata.com.np)[4](https://rooster.jobs/18183). These efforts align with Nepal Rastra Bank’s vision for a cashless  economy, leveraging Ayata’s expertise in scalable fintech architectures[4](https://rooster.jobs/18183).

Ayata’s development team employs agile methodologies,  utilizing frameworks like Flutter and Jetpack Compose to build  cross-platform applications with rapid iteration cycles[3](https://np.linkedin.com/company/ayata-inc)[4](https://rooster.jobs/18183). The company emphasizes modular system design, ensuring that solutions  like Medicord can integrate with legacy healthcare IT systems through  API-first architectures[6](https://ayata.com.np/works.php)[7](https://ayataintelligence.com). Code reviews and continuous integration pipelines maintain high  standards, evidenced by accolades in UI/UX design from professional  communities[2](https://ayata.com.np)[6](https://ayata.com.np/works.php).



## 4.1 

Ayata’s clientele spans multinational organizations,  reflecting its capacity to deliver enterprise-grade solutions. The World Health Organization (WHO) collaborates on digitizing disease  surveillance systems, while the World Wide Fund (WWF) utilizes Ayata’s  geospatial analytics for conservation projects[2](https://ayata.com.np)[10](https://ayata.com.np/services.php). In the financial sector, Nepal’s top banks rely on Ayata for core  banking upgrades, transaction security, and customer relationship  management (CRM) tools[1](https://ayata.com.np/about.php)[2](https://ayata.com.np). These partnerships validate Ayata’s technical proficiency and adaptability to diverse regulatory environments.



## 5.1 

Despite Nepal’s progress in mobile connectivity, rural  areas face persistent barriers: limited internet access, low digital  literacy, and infrastructural gaps. Ayata’s initiatives, such as  offline-enabled apps and community training programs, aim to mitigate  these challenges but require sustained investment[2](https://ayata.com.np)[4](https://rooster.jobs/18183). For example, Avyaas’s 3D modules are optimized for low-bandwidth  environments, while Medicord’s blockchain architecture reduces  dependency on continuous connectivity[2](https://ayata.com.np)[3](https://np.linkedin.com/company/ayata-inc). However, scaling these solutions demands collaboration with government  agencies and NGOs to subsidize device costs and expand broadband  coverage[4](https://rooster.jobs/18183).

## 5.2 

As a for-profit social enterprise, Ayata balances  revenue generation with developmental goals. While client projects and  software licensing provide steady cash flow, R&D for projects like  Aura relies on grants from organizations like USAID and ASHA Japan[1](https://ayata.com.np/about.php)[10](https://ayata.com.np/services.php). The company’s 2023 financial reports indicate a 40% revenue increase  YoY, yet long-term sustainability hinges on securing venture capital for market expansion[9](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/10449426)[10](https://ayata.com.np/services.php). Ayata’s upcoming Series A funding round targets $5M to scale Medicord’s deployment across South Asia, reflecting investor confidence in its  healthtech vertical[3](https://np.linkedin.com/company/ayata-inc)[7](https://ayataintelligence.com).

Ayata plans to launch an AI-powered chatbot integrated  with Medicord, enabling patients to query medical records and receive  diagnostic suggestions via natural language processing[3](https://np.linkedin.com/company/ayata-inc)[7](https://ayataintelligence.com). Concurrently, Avyaas will introduce adaptive learning algorithms that  personalize content based on student performance metrics, a feature  developed in partnership with Kathmandu University’s AI lab[3](https://np.linkedin.com/company/ayata-inc)[10](https://ayata.com.np/services.php). These advancements align with Ayata Intelligence’s research into  federated learning models, which train AI systems on decentralized data  without compromising privacy[7](https://ayataintelligence.com).

## 6.2 

Geographically, Ayata aims to establish offices in  Bangladesh and Sri Lanka by 2026, leveraging Nepal’s success as a  blueprint for neighboring markets[4](https://rooster.jobs/18183)[8](https://ayatacommerce.com/about-us/). Politically, the company advocates for stronger data protection laws in collaboration with Nepal’s Ministry of Communication, seeking to  standardize health data interoperability and cybersecurity protocols[3](https://np.linkedin.com/company/ayata-inc)[10](https://ayata.com.np/services.php). Internally, Ayata prioritizes talent development through internships  and partnerships with engineering colleges, cultivating a pipeline of  skilled developers versed in AI and blockchain technologies[3](https://np.linkedin.com/company/ayata-inc)[4](https://rooster.jobs/18183).

**TEAM MEMBERS:**

Employees range from 20-50. Location is located at Anamnagar, Kathmandu.  Has main projects points for Asha in fields like LIkhu Municipality( which is in Ramechaap) and also Gadhwa ( Rajpur ). Ayata grooms employees very well by leaving them with very high flexibility which allows them to develop into world class coders in their own fields.
